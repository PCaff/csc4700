What is your favorite movie?
    Right now, my favorite movie would be Ex Machina. If you havn't seen it, I highly recommend it.

If you could go anywhere in the world for vacation, where would it be?
    I would definitely go to Ireland again. I went in high school for a 3-game rugby tour and absolutely fell in love.

If you could have any super power, what would it be (and why that power)?
    The ability to never be hungover. My head is killing me right now..
